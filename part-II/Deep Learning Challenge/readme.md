# DeepArmor Data Science Challenge

## Part II - Deep Learning Challenge

This is the deep learning challenge section. 

You will find in this repo a resources folder containing your data and a diagram of a basic inception block implementation for your reference.

Please complete the challenge as outlined in the python (.py) script.

A few notes if you are considering this section:
* This is not a challenge of how fast your gpu is; the dataset is trivially small and we do not expect you to train/optimize a model
* Subsequently, this challenge focuses on understanding and programming capability
* You may organize your code however you like; putting your model DAG in a separate file is recommended but not necessary
* Please document your code as you would normally do. Code with obvious functionality need not be documented (use your discretion)
* We love to see your thought process, so please feel free to add in any verbage you like that reflects what you were thinking as you worked through the challenge.
